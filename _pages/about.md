I am a third year PhD student in the Applied Physics Program at Northwestern University. I work in the ([X-ray microscopy group](http://xrm.phys.northwestern.edu/), PI : [Prof. Chris Jacobsen](http://xrm.phys.northwestern.edu/~jacobsen/) ) on computational x-ray diffraction algorithms and imaging techniques. Our group performs experiments at the Advanced Photon Source (among other synchrotrons) and we have an allocation on the theta supercomputer at ALCF.

My research deals with simulations of zone plates to better understand their tilt misalignment limits. I have written programs that calculate x-ray diffraction form inhomogenous matter for large scale objects. I have also lead the evaluation of high aspect ratio zone plates fabricated using the MACE technique.

Apart from my specific research topics, I'm also interested in maintaining tools for scientific computing and contributing to sustainable community driven codes. Feel free to connect with me if your research interests or passions happen to align!
