I am a Research Associate in the Scientific Computing Division at Fermilab. I am involved in two SciDAC4 projects: HEPonHPC and ComPASS4, the former deals with adapting HEP workflows to harness HPC resources, while the latter deals with developing software to model particle accelerators.

Apart from my specific research topics, I'm interested in maintaining tools for scientific computing and contributing to sustainable community driven codes. Feel free to connect with me if your research interests or passions happen to align!
