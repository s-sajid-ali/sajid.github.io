I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at NYU, where I work with researchers to assist in implementing appropriate software solutions and provide consultations to faculty and research teams aimed at improving the competitiveness of funding proposals.

Apart from my specific research topics, I'm interested in maintaining tools for scientific computing and contributing to sustainable community driven projects. Feel free to connect with me if your research interests or passions happen to align!
